//    A classic RPG will have the hero going through different scenarios and battling their enemies.

//    Display enemy stats and hero stats. Properties and values can be assigned by you.

//    For example: Health, Attack Points, etc.
//    Decide on what actions your hero can take.
//    Attack (decreases enemyHealth)
//    Drink potion (adds to heroHealth)
//    Run? (ends the game)
//    Keep asking for user input until the enemyHealth reaches 0, then end the game.
